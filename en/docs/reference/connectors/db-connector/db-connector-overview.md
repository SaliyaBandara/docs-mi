# DB Connector Overview

The DB Connector allows you to connect to and interact with various relational databases using JDBC. It enables you to perform operations such as executing queries (SELECT), data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), calling stored procedures, and managing transactions directly from your WSO2 Micro Integrator integration flows.
